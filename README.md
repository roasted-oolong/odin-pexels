# pexels-api
Basic photo widget created using Ruby on Rails. Uses my personal Pexels gallery to display photos to the widget!

Master Key: 0a56abc124e92ff309d95d962ad921dc
⚠️ I would never expose the master key in a real project. Master key has been added here because this project was developed in a remote coding environment.
